Is it the Halving? Or is it Global Liquidity?

Every 4 years, the block subsidy of Bitcoin is cut in half. Historically, a bull run follows. But correlation is not causation, or at least, not the *whole* causation.

## The Liquidity Tide

Global M2 money supply tends to expand in cycles that surprisingly align with the crypto market.

- **Central Banks**: When they print, risk assets fly.
- **Credit Cycles**: Easy money fuels speculation.

## The Thesis

We are entering a period where **monetary debasement** is the base case for sovereign debt management. In this environment, hard assets (Gold, BTC) and productive tech monopolies (Nasdaq) become the only lifeboats.

The chart doesn't lie, but it can deceive. Look at the liquidity flows, not just the candles.
