Price is an advertisement. Liquidity is the product.

Most retail traders obsess over price action, patterns, and indicators. But the "smart money"—HFT firms, market makers, and institutional desks—obsess over **liquidity**.

## The Order Book

Imagine the order book as a topographical map of intent.
- **Bids**: The floor.
- **Asks**: The ceiling.
- **Spread**: The cost of immediacy.

When you place a market order, you are crossing the spread and demanding liquidity. You are the "taker." When you place a limit order, you are providing liquidity. You are the "maker."

### Predator vs. Prey

In the world of high-frequency trading (HFT), algorithms sniff out liquidity imbalances.

> The market seeks the price level where the maximum volume of trade can occur.

If you understand where the liquidity is (stop losses, liquidation levels), you understand where the price is likely to go. It's like gravity.
