Welcome to **Think Clear Hq**. This is the first post in my new digital garden.

## Why this site exists

I wanted a place that was completely *mine*—not rented from a platform, not subject to algorithm changes. A static site, built with modern tools, that I can curate and grow over time.

### The Stack

This site is built with:
- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **Tailwind CSS** (v4)
- **framer-motion** (for the liquid effects)
- **MDX** (for writing)

## What's Next?

I'll be writing about:
1. Financial Markets
2. Design System architecture
3. Mental models for problem solving

Stay tuned.
