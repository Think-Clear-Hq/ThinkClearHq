It is a common sight for Indian traders: wake up, check how the Nasdaq closed overnight, and then predict how the Nifty IT sector will open. The correlation between US technology stocks and Indian IT services companies is one of the most reliable relationships in the market. But why does this link exist?

## The Revenue Connection

The primary reason is fundamental. The giants of Indian IT—TCS, Infosys, Wipro—derive a massive chunk (often 50-60% or more) of their revenue from North America. Their clients are the very companies listed on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

When US tech companies are booming, it signals a strong economy and high corporate spending budgets. This means more contracts for cloud migration, digital transformation, and software maintenance for Indian IT firms. Conversely, when US tech crashes due to recession fears, IT budgets are the first to be slashed, directly impacting the order books of Indian service providers.

## Sentiment Spillover

Beyond direct revenue, there is the factor of global investor sentiment. The Nasdaq serves as the global proxy for "risk-on" appetite in the technology sector. When global funds pour capital into technology, they tend to buy the sector globally—buying Microsoft in New York and Infosys in Mumbai simultaneously.

## Decoupling?

Interestingly, there have been brief periods of decoupling. Domestic factors, such as the rupee-dollar exchange rate, can cushion or amplify the impact. A weaker rupee is generally good for Indian IT exporters, which can sometimes offset a slowdown in US demand.

## Strategy for Investors

For an investor in India, holding both specific US tech stocks (via the Nasdaq 100) and Indian IT funds can lead to overlap risk. While they offer diversification in terms of currency (USD vs INR), the underlying business cycles are deeply intertwined. True diversification might mean looking beyond IT when pairing US and Indian equities.
