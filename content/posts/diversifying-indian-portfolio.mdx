For decades, the standard advice for Indian investors was simple: Buy gold, buy real estate, and maybe put some money in Fixed Deposits. As the equity culture grew, the Nifty 50 became the new favorite. But there remains a massive "home bias"—most Indian portfolios are 100% exposed to the Indian economy.

## The Case for Diversification

India is undoubtedly a high-growth market. However, it is an emerging market, which comes with higher volatility. The US market (S&P 500 or Nasdaq) represents a developed economy with global currency dominance.

The correlation between the Indian and US markets is not perfect. There are times when India underperforms while the US rallies, and vice versa. By holding assets in both, you smooth out the volatility curve of your portfolio.

## The Currency Hedge

One of the biggest hidden benefits of US investing is the currency hedge. Historically, the Indian Rupee has depreciated against the US Dollar by about 3-4% annually over the long term.

When you invest in US stocks, you are holding a dollar-denominated asset. If the dollar strengthens against the rupee, your portfolio value in INR terms goes up, even if the stock price stays flat. It acts as a natural hedge against inflation and currency depreciation.

## Access to Innovation

While India has great companies, the US is home to the global leaders in technology, pharmaceuticals, and aerospace—sectors that are underrepresented or different in the Indian market. You cannot buy a Google, Apple, or Nvidia on the NSE. To own the innovators shaping the global future, you need US exposure.

## How to Do It

Today, access is easier than ever. Indian investors can use:
1.  **Feeder Mutual Funds:** Indian funds that invest in international ETFs.
2.  **LRS (Liberalised Remittance Scheme):** Directly remitting money to a US broker (though this involves higher paperwork and TCS tax implications).
3.  **Gift City:** The new IFSC regulations are opening up easier routes for dollar investing.

## Conclusion

A truly robust portfolio is a global one. Allocating even 10-15% of a portfolio to US equities provides stability, currency protection, and access to the world's best businesses.
